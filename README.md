# Developer Access
The Speech Recognition API provides the ability to convert spoken audio to text by sending audio to Microsoftâ€™s servers in the cloud. Developers have a choice of using the REST API or the Client Library.

* Using the REST API means getting only one reco result back with no partial results. Documentation for the REST API can be found here and code samples here.
* Using the client library allows for real-time streaming, meaning that as audio is being sent or spoken to the server, partial recognition results are returned at the same time. Real-time streaming is supported on Android, iOS, and Windows.
